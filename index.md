I am currently an undergraduate student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I will be completing a [B.S. in Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) with a [Minor in Robotics](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu/) in the **Fall of 2021**.

I am expected to start an [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/academics/graduate-studies) in the **Spring of 2022** with a concentration in [Systems and Controls](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/tigs/systems-controls).

## research

My research interests are in the areas of robotics, optimal control, and optimization. I have extensive hardware and software experience in research applications related to multicopter and autonomous driving platforms. 

Through my coursework I have been recently interested in the intersection of reinforcement learning and controls. I will continue to pursue curriculum in machine learning areas as I finish my degree.
