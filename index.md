I am currently an undergraduate student at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I will be completing a [B.S. in Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/) with a [Minor in Robotics](http://www.robotics.gatech.edu/) in the **Fall of 2021**. 

I will be starting an [M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/academics/graduate-studies) in the **Spring of 2022**. 

In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, and [ocassionally getting punched in the face](https://georgiatechboxing.com/).

## research

My research interests are in the areas of autonomous robotics systems, control, perception, and deep reinforcement learning. I have developed applications in these areas through projects related to autonomous driving vehicles, water surface vehicles and aerial vehicles (multi-copters). 

Through my coursework and research work at Sandia National Laboratories, I have been recently interested in the intersection of machine learning and controls - namely deep reinforcement learning. I will continue to pursue this research area in my coursework as I begin my graduate career at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
