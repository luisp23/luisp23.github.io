I am currently a student at Heritage High School and the Rockdale College and Career Academy (RCA). At RCA I am enrolled in the Electronics, Computer Science, and Computer Networking pathways. Each pathway consists of 3 years of coursework in the subject area.<br>
I am an RCA Student Ambassador, a member of my home school's Model Arab League, National Honor Society, and Varsity Tennis team.
<br><br>        
When I am not studying for my classes I am working on any of my different projects that usually include computers, electronics, micro-controllers etc.
