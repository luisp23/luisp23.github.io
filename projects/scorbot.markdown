In the manufacturing lab, at my school, sits a big blue robot arm called Scorbot. This robot arm was given to the school's manufacturing department from a surplus of equipment from another school. I thought it was curious I had never seen this robot arm being operated. After asking my APCS teacher, (also the manufacturing instructor) he informed me that to operate the arm we needed both the arm's accompanying controller and PC card; both of which we did not have. The total cost to buy these parts and get the arm operating would be at least $1000. I had a better idea - we could control the motors on the arm using an Arduino.

Luckily I found a fellow maker on the internet who had already begun developing an Arduino based controller like the one I needed. His controller would simply use L293D drivers and a 12V power source to drive different motors on the robot as per the code. I will make use of his base code and encoder to program the arm for specific tasks. Then I can build an interface for other students in Robotics and Computer Science can easily program the arm. The total cost: <b>less than $40. </b> <a href="http://www.whatimade.today/my-name-is-scorbot/"> Details for this project can be found here.</a>


In the next month I will begin building this controller. Hopefully, we can get our own Scorbot up and running again, putting it to good use.
