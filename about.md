<p>
I am a first-year graduate student at the <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> working towards my <a href="" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>. My current research interests are in the areas of <strong>robotics</strong> and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. I aspire to build robots that can understand the real world, and learn how to intelligently navigate it.

<p>
I graduated with my <a href="" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and Minor in Robotics</a> from Georgia Tech. I have specialized in robotics coursework related to control systems, autonomy, perception, machine learning, and have worked on multiple robotics platforms including autonomous racecars, surface vehicles, and multicopters.

<p>
I am currently a Graduate Researh & Development Intern at <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">Sandia National Laboratories</a> working on robotics technologies and research applications in the <a href="https://autonomy.sandia.gov/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">AutonomyNM Robotarium</a>.

In my time at Georgia Tech I've had the opportunity to contribute to multiple robotics research projects in laboratories including <a href="https://autorally.github.io/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">AutoRally</a> <strong>(Summer 2016, Fall 2017-Spring 2018)</strong>, <a href="https://www.vip.gatech.edu/teams/active-safety-autonomous-and-semi-autonomous-vehicles" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">VIP: Active Safety for Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous Vehicles</a> <strong>(Fall 2018-Spring 2019)</strong>, and <a href="https://dream.georgiatech-metz.fr/research-projects/rc-car/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">The DREAM Lab</a> <strong>(Fall 2019)</strong>. I am also a former  Undergraduate Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">Georgia Tech Research Institute</a> <strong>(Summer 2018)</strong>.

In my free time I enjoy reading, <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">listening to podcasts</a>, and <a href="https://georgiatechboxing.com/" style="text-decoration:none;font-weight:bold">ocassionally getting punched in the face</a>.
